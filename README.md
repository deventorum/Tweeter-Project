# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Express is used as a backend. Application is secured against scripting attacks. MongoDB was used to manage database of users and tweets. The application is optimized for mobile phones with responsive design. JQuery library was used on the frontend. User registration is implemented, so only users who are logged in can post tweets.
